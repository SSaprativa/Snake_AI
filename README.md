# Snake AI: A Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository contains the code for a Python project that teaches an AI to play the classic game of Snake using Deep Q-Learning. The project is broken down into a four-part tutorial series, available on [your YouTube channel link].

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a Snake AI from scratch, covering the following aspects:

* **Reinforcement Learning:** Implementing a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to train the AI agent.
* **Game Environment:** Creating the Snake game environment using Pygame.
* **AI Agent:** Developing an agent that interacts with the game environment and makes decisions.
* **Neural Network:** Building a neural network using PyTorch to predict the optimal moves for the snake.
